System:      He (2 electrons) separated by 200 Ang from He (2 electrons)
Level:       HF-exch with 6-311G for helium
Compare to:  Corresponding RHF calculation for isolated He

Results:     Test passes when G ansatz is used. See README file in each ansatz_G/ directory for each basis set
             Test fails when 1+G ansatz is used.
