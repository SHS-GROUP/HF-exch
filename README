Approximate-exchange Hartree-Fock (HF-exch)
 - approach which partitions electrons into two subsystems: A and B
 - electronic exchange is included within A or B, but not between A and B

To compile a specific file in the cwd:
 - switch to directory containing *.f and execute ./comp [fname]
 - move resulting object file to object/ before linking

To compile all files necessary for program:
 - switch to source/ and execute ./compall
 - automatically moves all object files to object/

To link all object files generated by compall into an executable runXCHF.exe:
 - switch to source/ and execute ./lked runXCHF

Running HF-exch:
 - Input file:  basis_definition.inp (must have this name)
 - Check test folders for format
 - Format for basis functions is:
   <primitive index> <contract index> <ang mom-x,y,z> <exponent> <contract coeff> <basis center x,y,z>
 - MO eigenvectors are output to FinalCAE.dat and FinalCBE.dat
