System:      He (2 electrons) separated by 200 Ang from He (2 electrons)
Level:       HF-exch with 6-311G for helium
Compare to:  Corresponding RHF calculation for isolated He

GAMESS:
            ONE ELECTRON ENERGY =      -3.8860484102
            TWO ELECTRON ENERGY =       1.0261529856
                   TOTAL ENERGY =      -2.8598954246

Results:
 - one-electron energy of each subsystem is the same as GAMESS with additional E(e-,He)=-Enuc
 - two-electron energy of each subsystem is the same as GAMESS
 - interaction energy is exactly Enuc
 - total energy is thus two times the isolated energy


======
TEST02
======

Same as TEST01 but with open-shell calculation (one alpha / one beta electron for each subsystem)

Results:
 - gives same energy as closed-shell case
 - alpha and beta orbitals are exactly the same for each subsystem
